        <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-300">9.1 Intuition and Motivation</h3>
        <p>
            Economics is largely about studying human behaviour, and game theory is the branch of economics and mathematics used to study what humans do when they must \textit{interact} with each other.
        </p>

        <div class="note">
            <p class="font-bold mb-2">Note</p>
            <p>
                Game theory provides a systematic way to model strategic situations: settings in which each participant’s outcome depends not only on their own choices, but also on the choices of others.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>Let’s look at some everyday examples:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mt-3">
            <li>
                <strong class="text-[#ff9900]">Roommates cleaning their apartment</strong> — Each person prefers a clean room, but would rather the other person do the cleaning. (This is the \textit{freeloader problem}).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong class="text-[#ff9900]">Two people competing for the same romantic partner</strong> — Each would like to win, but is only willing to pursue if he believes that he can put in more effort than the other pusuers. (This resembles a \textit{war of attrition}).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-4">In order to study such situations formally, we need to think about what makes up a game.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-300">9.2 Building a Model</h3>
        <p>The first step is to recognise how many \textbf{players} (actors) are in the interaction. For now, assume there are just two players.</p>
        <p>Since this is a ``game'' of sorts, we must specify the \textbf{actions} available to each player. Following Osborne’s notation, let $S$ denote the set of actions (or \textbf{strategies}).</p>
        <p>Suppose each player has three actions available. This already resembles a normal human interaction: each side has multiple possible choices.</p>
        <p>Now, to evaluate the outcomes of these actions, we need a way to \textbf{measure preferences}. In microeconomics, agents are modeled as maximizing a \textbf{utility function}. The same idea applies here: each player has payoffs that reflect how much they value different outcomes.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-300">9.3 Example Game</h3>
        <p>Consider the following payoff matrix for a two-player game. Player 1 chooses a row, Player 2 chooses a column, and the entries represent utilities (Player 1 first, Player 2 second):</p>

        <div class="overflow-x-auto my-4">
            <table class="payoff-table mx-auto text-sm sm:text-base">

        <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-300">9.4 Formal Definition of a Game</h3>
        <div class="definition">
            <p class="font-bold mb-2">Definition</p>
            <p>A (normal-form) game is defined by the triple</p>
            <div class="math-display">
                $$ G = (N, (S_i)_{i \in N}, (u_i)_{i \in N}) $$
            </div>
            <p>where:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
                <li>$N$ is the set of players,</li>
                <li>$S_i$ is the set of strategies available to player $i$,</li>
                <li>$u_i: \prod_{j \in N} S_j \to \mathbb{R}$ is the utility (payoff) function of player $i$.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Note that we are not restricting ourselves to finite sets. The strategy set of a player can be infinite. For example, a firm choosing a price may select any positive real number.</p>
        <p>In our example, $N = \{1,2\}$, each player has three actions ($S_1 = S_2 = \{A, B, C\}$), and the utility functions $u_1, u_2$ are given by the payoff matrix above.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-300">9.5 Solution Concepts</h3>
        <p>Having defined a game, the next natural question is:</p>
        <p class="text-center italic font-semibold my-4">“What will actually happen?”</p>
        <p>If each player tries to maximize their utility, the answer is not straightforward:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mt-3">
            <li>There may be no single strategy profile that simultaneously maximizes both players’ utilities.</li>
            <li>Each player only cares about their own utility, not the other’s. (Although we could model altruism, it complicates the framework and is beyond our current scope.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-4">The first solution concept we introduce is \textbf{domination}.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-300">9.6 Dominated Strategies</h3>
        <p>Returning to our example: notice that for Player 1, action $C$ never makes sense. No matter what Player 2 does, Player 1 is better off choosing some other action.</p>

        <div class="definition">
            <p class="font-bold mb-2">Definition</p>
            <p>A strategy $s_i \in S_i$ is \textbf{strictly dominated} if there exists another strategy $s'_i \in S_i$ such that</p>
            <div class="math-display">
                $$ u_i(s'_i, s_{-i}) > u_i(s_i, s_{-i}) \quad \text{for all } s_{-i} \in S_{-i}. $$
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="note">
            <p class="font-bold mb-2">Key assumptions when modeling domination:</p>
            <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-1">
                <li>Rational players will not choose strictly dominated strategies.</li>
                <li>All players are rational.</li>
                <li>Rationality is \textbf{common knowledge} (everyone knows, everyone knows that everyone knows, and so on).</li>

        </div>

        <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-300">9.7 Iterated Elimination of Strictly Dominated Strategies</h3>
        <p>If Player 2 knows Player 1 is rational, she can eliminate action $C$ of Player 1 from consideration. After this, Player 2 may realize that her own action $B$ is strictly dominated, and eliminate it as well. This process continues back and forth.</p>

        <div class="shaded">
            <p class="font-bold mb-2 text-lg">Worked Example: Iterated Elimination</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
                <li>For Player 1, $C$ is strictly dominated.</li>
                <li>After $C$ is removed, for Player 2, $B$ is strictly dominated.</li>
                <li>After $B$ is removed, for Player 1, $B$ is strictly dominated.</li>
                <li>After this, for Player 2, $C$ is strictly dominated.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-3">This game is solvable by iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies, and the unique solution is:</p>

                    The dilemma arises because $(C,C)$ is the outcome predicted by iterated elimination (since confessing strictly dominates staying silent), but this outcome is \textbf{inefficient}: both players would prefer $(S,S)$, which gives them only $-1$ years each instead of $-5$.

        <p>Up to now, we have assumed players always choose a single action. Such a choice is called a \textbf{pure strategy}.</p>
        <p>But what if a player randomizes between their available actions? This leads us to the idea of \textbf{mixed strategies}.</p>

            <p class="font-bold mb-2">Definition: Mixed Strategy</p>
            <p>A mixed strategy for player $i$ is a probability distribution $\sigma_i$ over the set $S_i$ of pure strategies.</p>

        <p>We denote mixed strategies by $\sigma_i$ and pure strategies by $s_i$.</p>

        <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mt-3">
            <li>The indifference principle is powerful for 2×2 (and small) games: to compute a mixed equilibrium find probabilities that make opponents indifferent between the pure strategies they mix over.</li>
            <li>A mixed strategy can sometimes (weakly or strictly) dominate a pure strategy: when the expected payoff from randomization exceeds that of a pure action for every opponent profile.</li>
            <li>Matching Pennies illustrates why mixed strategies are essential: the only equilibrium is mixed (each player randomizes with $p=\tfrac{1}{2}$).</li>
